# Car Wash Management System
This is a C++ and Qt-based application designed to manage car wash operations efficiently.
It provides an interactive graphical interface for handling cars, managing a waiting list, and exporting data.

## Features
The application allows users to perform CRUD operations such as adding, modifying, and deleting cars in the main inventory.
Users can sort the cars by various criteria, including registration number, producer, model, or type,
and search for cars using specific attributes like registration, producer, model, or type.

In the Car Wash module, users can manage a waiting list by adding cars manually or generating random cars.
The waiting list can be cleared with a single action,
and users can export the list to CSV or HTML files for easy sharing or reporting.
The waiting list table updates dynamically in real time.

The main window of the application provides forms and buttons for CRUD operations.
It also includes a search and sorting section to easily find and organize cars.
The Car Wash module allows you to manage the waiting list and export data.
All actions are accompanied by user-friendly error handling,
ensuring smooth operation and clear communication of issues.

## How to run it?
To run the application, you need to install the Qt framework and
have a compatible C++ compiler, such as GCC, MSVC, or Clang.
You can clone the repository, open the project in an IDE like CLion, and build and run the application from there.
